###Description
In this program, the user is to input their name and age. The program then prints a greeting with the user's name, and adds five to their age, telling them their age in five years.

###Usage
To install the software, download "something.py" and run it in a python3-equipped terminal. Type responses to the prompts.

You can check if you have python3 installed by entering the command `python3 --version`

###Contribution
To contribute, create a fork of the code and modify it in your preferred environment. Create a pull request to submit your contribution, and we will evaluate it.
